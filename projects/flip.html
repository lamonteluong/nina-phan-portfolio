            <h2>Role</h2>
            <p>
                As one of three product designers at Ontario Digital Service Lab working on multiple projects, I wore many hats from project scoping, problem assessment, user recruitment, user research to ideation. <br><br>
                On this particular project, I collaborated closely with two product design interns to assess our problem, recruit vendors for user research, design our prototypes, facilitate <strong>17 user interviews and usability testing sessions</strong>, and synthesize and present our findings to our clients over the span of a six week sprint. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                The Mandatory Information Program (MIP) is a two-hour, judicially- mandated session that provides family law litigants with information about the family justice system, options available to resolve their family law disputes, and the effects of relationship breakdown on children and adults. <br><br>
                When a litigant files for a court case, they are given a <strong>MIP notice</strong> that instructs them to attend an in-person MIP session with date and location details.  The Family Law Rules require family law litigants to attend a MIP no later than 45 days after a case has been started.  Otherwise, their case cannot move forward. 
            </p>

            </div>

            <a class="hideSideNav"></a>

            <p>
                Once a MIP has been attended, the litigant is provided a certificate of completion, which the court files in the continuing record. <br><br>
                The lack of a provincially accepted method for delivering MIPs off-site presents an issue for clients who may not be able to attend in-person, due to injuries, travel restriction or childcare issues.

                We have observed that MIP isn’t meeting the public’s need for early, convenient and multi-channel access to user-friendly information about the family justice system in Ontario, which is causing people to spend too much time and resources navigating the legal system. <br>

            <p>
                In an effort to show the Ministry of the Attorney General how a slideshow can be enhanced for better learning, we redesigned the slide deck for the division of property lesson in the program to include examples and visuals. We changed the name of the Mandatory Information Program to the <strong>Family Law Information Program</strong> to be indicative of the contents of the program.

                The benefits of using off-the-shelf software are reduced, since major customizations most likely need to be made to improve the user experience. 
                After testing two iterations of this hypothesis, we decided that a LMS is not a good solution for offering the MIP because it contains extra features that clog up the user’s experience. <br><br>
                From insights drawn from usability testing, we discovered a new type of user. We created a fictional persona of someone who is in the information gathering stage and have not officially began dispute resolution in or out of court.

                    <li>
                        People would have access to family law information earlier in their journey. This would reduce the chance of mistakenly bringing family law cases to court. It could simultaneously result in an increase in uptake of mediation services.

                        We could have been more productive had we spent more time understanding the domain of family law. There were times when we had to scrap a prototype because we did not thoroughly understand the legal process.

                        We put a lot of effort into recruitment with anticipation that participants would be eager to sign up. When designing in a sensitive domain, such as family law, I think reaching out to family, friends and colleagues garners more guarantee for participation. The lengthy email exchange that replaced the initial plan to host a survey online may have also deterred the public from following through with signing up.  It is important to doublecheck with the team about mandatory approval processes that may exist.
