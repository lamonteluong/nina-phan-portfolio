            <h2>Role</h2>
            <p>
                In my third year biomedical engineering design course, we were instructed to solve any problem within the domain of Dementia. The only requirements given were that the end product had to incorporate at least two disciplines of engineering (i.e. software, mechanical, electrical, etc.). <br><br>
                On this particular project, I was responsible for project scoping, secondary research, product ideation and the design and testing of our user interface.

            <h2>Project Scoping</h2>
            <p>
                Before project scoping, we set out to obtain necessary domain knowledge to understand the problem space of dementia. We had discussions with subject matter experts who work with patients with dementia in Grand River Hospital, and subject matter experts who work for the Alzheimer Society of Canada. Following the Google SPRINT methodology, the team and I started project scoping by setting our long-term goal to “address health conditions of patients with dementia”. Later, the team conducted <span><strong>user interviews with a geriatric nurse and resident physician</strong></span> from the Grand River Hospital. The research notes from the meeting were then reviewed by the team to generate “How Might We” (HMW) questions. After classifying the HMW questions into focused problem spaces, all team members voted on the spaces that they were most interested in. We selected our focused problem space to be “recognition loss of declining health conditions”.

                I created a fictional persona based off of research findings from our user interview with the geriatric nurse from Grand River Hospital and discussions with subject matter experts.

            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>
                Individuals with dementia often have trouble with recognition [1]; this can lead them to be unable to identify when their personal health begins to decline. Caregivers have the tough task of determining when their patients’ health begins to decrease and the cause. If patient health declines and remains unchecked for a long period of time, it could lead to severe health implications. <br><br>
                The system we design will aim to allow caregivers to continuously monitor vital signs of their patients and detect changes in vitals. Since the design and development of the system is to be completed in a three month timespan and the budget for the project is approximately $200, the scope of this project was to develop a proof of concept for a single system that offers continuous vital monitoring to caregivers.

                We looked into <strong>existing vital monitoring technologies</strong> on the market or in the research phase. This helped us identify features taht we could realistically implement within out solution. We went on to do extensive secondary research in <strong>metrics</strong> for our designed solution.

                    The caregivers are the primary users of the product as they are responsible for attaching the sensor to the patient and monitoring the application for changes in vital signs. The solution must be easy to remove and attach for the primary users, and it should stay in place via an adhesion factor. Since the primary user is interacting with the application interface they require the UI to be have great usability based on its learnability, consistency, autonomy, latency reduction, simplicity, accessibility and general aesthetics. Also, it is vital for the alerting system and sensors to be accurate, reliable, quick, and recognizable. The secondary user is the individual with dementia residing in either a long term care home or a specialized hospital wing. Since the device is worn for an extended period of time, it is important for the solution to be comfortable, which is based on multiple criteria such as size, weight, breathability and biocompatibility. Biocompatibility pertains to comfort as it is important for the device to not elicit an adverse skin reaction. Furthermore, it is necessary for the user data to be secure and confidential. The data criteria were reflected in the software section of the QFD. The hospital or long term care home would purchase the device for its patients and their criteria must be considered. As the tertiary users, they would want the designed solution to be as robust as possible including resistant to water, long lifespan, long battery life, have cross platform compatibility all while minimizing the overall cost. <br><br><br><br>
                    To design a practical system, the aforementioned criteria were translated into engineering specifications with corresponding metrics to guide the design process. As a rule of thumb, the team determined target values for the criteria under the “how” section by doubling or halving the researched threshold values depending on whether the value should be increased or decreased [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].

                Design a product that detects changes in blood oxygen and heart rate to allow caregivers to continuously monitor vital signs of their patients.
            </div>
            
            <p>
                We met with a <strong>resident physician</strong> from Grand River Hospital to discuss our sketched designs. We decided to design a reflectance pulse oximeter wearable device for patients with dementia, which will be used by caregivers to monitor blood oxygen percentage and heart rate of these patients. Heart rate and blood oxygen were chosen from all vitals because they were possible with our skillset, and they also indicate valuable information about a patient’s state of health.  Pulse oximeters can estimate the oxygen saturation by measuring the absorbance of light in wavelength ranges that correspond to Hb and HbO  concentrations [9]. Pulse oximetry has also been found to accurately estimate heart rate at rest and during submaximal exercise [10]. Caregivers will be assisting patients put the wearable device on their chest. Blood oxygen percentage and heart rate data will be sent from the pulse oximeter sensor on the device to a computer via Bluetooth. Caregivers will be interacting with the computer interface that displays the collected data and alerts. The designed solution can be viewed as three separate subsystems of hardware, backend, and frontend as shown below.

                The majority of the user interface related suggestions will be implemented in the next version of the prototype. Most suggestions revolved around designing for accessibility. For example, increasing contrast, having buttons accompanied with text, and decreasing the number of touch-points required to view certain patient information. However, the suggestion regarding the addition of a diagnosis feature will not be implemented. This is due to the limited time and scope of the project.

            <h2>Solution</h2>

            <p>
                The number of touch points in the interface was decreased for simplification by 20%, the visual contrast was addressed, and text was added to some buttons to clarify their functions. The UI should be tested again, with the improvements implemented, to ensure that they are adequate and producing the expected results. Furthermore, the UI should also be tested with nurses of diverse age groups to ensure that the design is not biased toward a specific age group. To recall, the user testing sessions were conducted with university students of age 20.

                Patient board list all patients with dementia, indicating which patients are  experiencing a decline in health. Colour was added to indicate priority of care. Side navigation bar was made sticky so nurses could traverse back to the patient board easily if they ventured into a patient profile or into devices.

                Data visualizations were brought to the forefront of patient profiles, since they were expressed as the most important information to our tested users and subject matter experts. Nurses can navigate to patient information and notes, which were deemed less useful.

                This is the first iteration of the device that needs to be attached to the patient’s chest for heart rate and blood oxygen monitoring. In the future, we would aim to decrease the size of the battery since it is accounting for 75% of the device’s container.

                    <li>
                        The accuracy and precision of the integrated circuit is limited because reflectance pulse oximetry technologies are fairly new
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Bluetooth is susceptible to noise and physical impedance. Unless the Bluetooth was optimized, this may present a long-term limitation in that data may become inaccurate or the datastream may become lost.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The hardware does not contain an ECG sensor. If ECG data was provided, more advanced analysis methods could be used. For example, people experiencing heart attacks have elevated ST segments in their ECG scans [11]. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The software algorithm only had basic heart rate data to analyze means that the only detection methods implemented were threshold checks. These threshold checks cannot conclusively identify what conditions are causing the increased or decreased heart rate. This problem also applies to the blood oxygen saturation model.

                    <li>
                        All patient data should be encrypted in order to assure users that their data is secure. Due to the time limitations of this project, no encryption was implemented, and data was directly stored in the database. This leaves data potentially exposed to people without proper access credentials.

            <h3>Recommendations for Future Steps</h3>

            <div>
                <ol class="num-list">
                    <li>
                        Implement ECG sensors to allow for more advanced algorithms that can detect issues other than elevated or lowered heart-rate and blood oxygen levels, such as atrial fibrillation and heart attacks. This would widen the use cases for the device and allow for higher monitoring accuracy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Implement better database scaling.  The current database is non-scalable and local, which limits  the amount of data that can be stored. Hosting the database on a cloud server would greatly increase the storage efficiency and size. Hosting fees would have to be paid, but this may be a necessary cost to pay.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Implement database encryption in order to increase patient data security. This recommendation is necessary if the design becomes more widely used as the current design has no safeguards against attacks as long as the hacker bypasses the login page.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Implement a better connection between the device and computer to improve the consistency of the datastream and viable range of the design. Alternative connections to the current Bluetooth low energy shield include Ultra Wideband, which has a more stable signal [12]. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The device along with the iterated UI should undergo multiple rounds of testing with nurses who care for patients with dementia. Nurses should be instructed not to heavily rely on the product. They should still follow their usual routine and check up on the patient’s vitals using their usual methods.

                        We could not control the number of user interviews we had since it was set by our professor. However, I should have taken the time to better prepare for the user interview to gain better research insights (i.e. preparing a more extensive script and practicing with friends and family).

                    <li>
                        Designing products to be integrated into the current way healthcare professionals work is difficult and lengthy. One needs in-depth domain knowledge regarding the current system and invest resources into recruiting these busy users for useful insights to validate design decisions.

                    <li>
                        If our team was given more time for this project and access to more users (i.e. physicians, nurses, other caregivers, etc.), I would have liked to explore other user research methodologies, such as participatory design to actively pick the brains of nurses and other caregivers.
