                Hi, I’m Nina! Once we meet and become friends, you can call me Neenz.  I’m currently studying Biomedical Engineering at the University of Waterloo. Think systems design engineering for biomedical applications.  Outside of class, I’m designing for social good at UW Blueprint, playing intramural basketball, performing guitar at coffeehouses and becoming a better hotdog connaisseur. <br><br>

                Previously, I’ve been a product designer at the Ontario Digital Service, and a UX designer at Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan. I know what you are thinking... 
            </p>

            <div id="about-quote">
                What is this girl doing designing government and pension services? That’s not related to biomedical engineering at all!
            </div>

            <p>
                I hope to bring my unique experiences of digitizing complex paper-based systems to the health and biotech sectors eventually. Currently, I’m looking to work on impactful products with teams that are not afraid of challenging the status quo.
            </p>
